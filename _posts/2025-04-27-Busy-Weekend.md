Don't feel liking writing that much so here is a photo dump of the weekend. You can open the images in a new tab to look at them at a larger size, they still won't be that high quality but its an option. On to talking about the actual weekend, On Saturday I went to the Festival of Books by way of public Transit (LA Metro E Line) and the Jackalope Indie Artisan Fair in Pasadena (1 of 4 different locations) on Sunday. If you are able to and you like books and artisan crafts, I would highly recommend checking out Festival of Books and Jackalope.

The only two things that I bought at the Festival of Books; no author signatures unfortunately. Heyday seems like a super cool publisher and honestly I wanted so many books that were at the booth. I had to hold back because new books are expensive.

Other than buys some awesome books, I saw so many interesting interesting and unique booths. But, the one that I thought was the coolest was the booth occupied by <a href="https://www.bittermelonbindery.com/">Bitter Melon Bindery</a>. Gorgeous items, super nice, and a very fleshed out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/bittermelonbindery">YouTube</a> channel with bookbinding tutorials.

After getting back to Alhambra (about an hour by public transit from USC) I had dinner at Borneo Kalimantan Cuisine. I really should make a dedicated food post on this place. Well, if I do that or not the future I just wanna say this place is delicious and the price is quite nice. Be wraned it can get quite busy during the lunch and dinner rush. The weakest aspect of the place is probably customer service but it really isn't that bad.

At the Jackalope Indie Artisan Fair I got a salted pretzel with mustard which was delicious, saw a really cute mushroom witch hat, and some No Face mugs (No Face is so goof, love him). A lot of other cool stuff, too much so I will not be including it.
