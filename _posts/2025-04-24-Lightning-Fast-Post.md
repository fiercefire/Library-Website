<p>Changed up the colors of the site and cleaned up a bunch of stuff in the back end of the site. Added the CA Library Systems map from the California State Library to all the posts 
talking about map updates. And added little source captions to the images. Hopefully, everything is looking better, cleaner, and easier to read.</p>

<p>Oh and expect a blog post tommororw about a food spot I tried today. </p>

<p>Thats it üèÉ.</p>
