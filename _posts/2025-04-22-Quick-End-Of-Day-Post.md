Another quick post about me stumbling around trying to build this site up. Yes, I am still adding more and more posts to test the limit on how many recent posts will show up on the 
home page sidebar. It should be 7, but I will probably increase the limit in the future. Anyway, no one should be reading these posts or even know about this site but if you are, 
you'll notice I scrpaped the left and right side sidebars in favor of a just a leftside sidebar. It has both the map legend and the recent posts in it. Also, the sidebar was going 
to block the whole screen on phones so I just made it disapper on any screens where the sidebar would overlap the main content. Web deisgn best practice is weeping right now but who 
cares this is for me and I mostly plan on only accessing the site on my PC. I did go on my phone to make sure everything was working fine and I am sad to report that my "Gorton 
Perfected" font does not work 😢. Not the end of the world since it works when I am on my PC but still a bit sad other people probably cannot see it. 

Ok! Map Update! I know I know. Finally. Sorry I have been distracted getting the basics of site together. I think it is in an alright posiion now. I am just missing a little here 
and there to spruce it up and give it some personality. Whoops, got ditracted again. The update is that I added in Region 5, 7, and 9. Region 5 is covered by the Black and Gold 
Cooperative Library System (San Luis Obispo County, Santa Barabra County, and a single library system from Ventura County), Region 7 by Santiago Library System (Orange County), and 
Region 9 made up of Sierra Cooperative Library System (San Diego and Imperial County). This is adding to the already added Region 6 which houses the consortium, Southern California 
Library Cooperative (Los Angeles and Ventura County). You might have also noticed that in the Google My Maps itself I have combined Regions 3-5 and 7+9. They share borders and and 
I wanted to even out the amount of markers for each layer. My Maps limits me to only 10 layers so I need to save layers where I can. Maybe one day all the public libraries of CA 
will be merged into one super layer. I also added a small smattering of various other instituations that I already visited in the past. I will try to revisist places so I can refresh 
myself before I write a blog post about them.

Final update for now is a fun one. I have decided to the get the Olympus OM-1n and I am paring it with the Olympus Zuiko 50mm f/1.8 Manual Focus Lens. So Excited! When I take photos 
I will need to use the film roll up and then get it developed. So, I will either need to delay posts or just write the post and update them with the photos later? I'm leaning towards 
the latter option currently.
