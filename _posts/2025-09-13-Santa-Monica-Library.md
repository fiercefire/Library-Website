Alright, here we are folks, I'm finally getting off my ass and not procrastinating with library posts. Time to talk about my visit to the Santa Monica Public Library on September 11th of 2025. I'm going to be honest, I am very tired right now so this will either be a lazy post or half finished and imporoved later.

This is the only picutre I took of the outside of the library. The building is quite large but otherwise not all that impressive to me. It was a tiny bit confusing and annoying to get
into the library because out of three seperate entrances there was only one open, the north entrance. They must have a lot of trouble at the library because at the north entrance there
are two security guards stationed. 

<br>

The inside of the library is quite spacious and colorful. There was some real nice shelving in the entrance area of the library and even a small courtyard in the center of the library.
Unfortunately, the library was somewhat confusing to navigate. There were a lot of dead ends and there were multiple areas that required appointments. Also there were a lot of doors that
were marked as emergency exit only. I also could not for the life of me find where the restrooms were. Turns out they were outside the main building.

<br>

Back to the actual building. The cafe in the courtyard area was closed sadly. The areas that needed appointments included the Santa Monica Collection (not the archives it was all books), 
periodicals, study rooms, and the individual workspaces. Although there did not appear to be an archive they do have a digital archive accessible on their website. In terms of selection
it seemed quite nice but I cannot speak too confidently on that since I didn't get to spend much time as I knew it would take a long time for me to get home. I will say the shelving 
was quite nicely organized and they had very nice shelve labeling.

While I was at the library I also checked out the bookstore which was very large. It was about 20 sheleves worth of books. It only opened at 3 PM which was quite odd. There were a lot of 
people waiting outside to go in as soon as it opened. The amount of people made it not so great to navigate around and look at books even with how big the room was. The bookstore overall 
was nice but not my favourite. Finally, attached to the library there was the Santa Monica History Musuem which was pretty cool. 

<br>

The process to get my library card was pretty simeple. They had printed forms out by the front desk that I was able to fill out ahead of time before talking to a librarian. All I needed
to show them was my california State ID Card with my current address on it and boom I had my free library card. 

<br> 

Getting to the library was pretty easy for me. All I needed to do was take a bus to downtown LA and catch the E line. The trip there took about 2 hours. The library itself is pretty
close to the downtown Santa Monica station, only about 1/2 mile away. Getting home I decided to take LA Metro bus line 4 all the way to union station where I could catch my bus back home.
Yes the route bus 4 takes is LOOOOONG, downtown Santa Monica to downtown LA. I was on that double long bus for a little over 2 hours and it got real croweded halfway through the
ride. The reason I took the bus home instead of the E line was becuase I was tempted to drop by the Beverly Hills Library on the way home but I was too tired and decided against it. And
thank goodness I did I ended getting home at like 8 PM. Yeesh.

OK I was so scattered brain while writing this, but too bad that's what you get. Buh Bye/
