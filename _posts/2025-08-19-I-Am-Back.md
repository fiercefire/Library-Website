Hey, I'm back. I was gone for a while cause I started temporarily working full time. Didn't 
have a lot of time or energy to do stuff. Anyway, I should hopefully be back to doing
more posts and going out. Unless you know school destroys me...

So posts about libraries I need to do... well, ALL of the ones that have been marked as 
green on the map. Whoops;;; :P. I have very sparse notes about them and, like, very few
photos so look forward to really short posts, haha. I should have a good amount of food 
to talk about, and I have started to hike once a week so I'll probably talk about that a 
little as well.

I'll try not to procrastinate too hard. Bye now. o_o/
