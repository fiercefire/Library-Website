Gosh third post of the day I am on a roll. You may have noticed the time at the top of this post. I plan to include that from now on for myself. The post will probably 
slow down in the future but for now they remain plentiful so I can test my home page. You may not have noticed since the site is pretty new, but I moved the recent posts from the 
bottom of the page to a left side bar. Should make it easier to find it. I also set the it to only show the most recent 10 posts so hopefully I have enough posts to see if that 
works eventually. No, I do not want to spam a bunch of posts and then delete them after. I am just gonna let nature take its course. I have also placed two map legends on a side 
bar to the right I think it looks good there but I may change it in the future.

Lets see. Oh yes I have enlarged the map (it the central concite of the site afterall) and added a small blog introduction underneath it. Maybe it would look better on top of the 
map? Probably not tho. Last of all I just dumped a bunch of random stuff into the "About Me" page. I have no clue where I am going with that page but I will figure something out 
eventually I suppose.

I'm gonna get out of here, it's getting late and I am really hungry. Until next time.
