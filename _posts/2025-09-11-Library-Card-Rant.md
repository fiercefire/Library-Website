So a couple days I was talking to a friend and found out that the Cerritos Library does not issue free library cards to people who don't meet one of these requirements:
<ul>
  <li>Lives in Cerritos</li>
  <li>Owns property in Cerritos</li>
  <li>Attends school in Cerritos</li>
  <li>Works in Cerritos</li>
  <li>Works for the ABC Unified School District or for Cerritos College</li>
  <li>Is a current student at ABC Unified School District, Bellflower Unified School Distric,t or Cerritos College</li>
  <li>Is currently staying at the Cerritos Sheraton</li>
  <li>Is an active military personnel who are permanent or temporary residents of California.</li>
</ul>
Which is super duper lame of them. I orginally wanted to go visit becuase people were telling how large and pretty it is. And yet they somehow don't want to participate in universal 
borrowing like other California public libraries? You cannot tell me they don't have enough money. Do they think that people are going to come from afar and steal all the books from
locals? They even have the audacity to say that non-residents can purchase a card for a $100 A YEAR?!? A Year?!?!? Like wow omg I am so grateful for your generosity City of Cerritos 
&#128530;. So fuck em I am not visiting out of principal.

Really quickly for anyone wondering what universal borrowing is, this is how the California State Libary defines it in their California Library Laws:
> Sec. 18731.  Universal borrowing.<br> 
> A California public library may participate in universal borrowing. A public library<br> 
> participating in universal borrowing shall not exclude the residents of any jurisdiction<br>
> maintaining a public library.<br>

This has started an troubling realization that there might be more libraries not participating in universal borrowing that I orginally imagained and now I have to individually go down
my libraries spreedsheet to check whether each library participates in universal borrowing. All this has really shown me is that so many libraries are organized horribly and how vague 
they can be in their wording. Don't even get me started on the libraries that don't have their own site and are embedded in the city government site. As a remindeer the first tab is 
the list with all the libraries systemsalong with ALL branches. The new second tab "Alphabetical" is just one row for each library in alphabetical order so I can track which libraries 
I have visited, which libraries I need to call to confirm of they participate in universal borrowing, and which libraries definately do not issue cards for free to non-residents.

Upcoming site updates and posts:
<ul>
  <li>Spreadsheet link on home page.</li>
  <li>Little floating counter for number of library cards obtained on the home page.</li>
  <li>Update map key to show black symbols as libraries not a part of universal borrowing.</li>
  <li>First library post should be incoming in a day or two it will be on Alhambra Library my hometown library and where I got my first library card.</li>
  <li>After that I should hopefully make a post soon after on the Sanata Monica Public Library which I just visited. I am going to try to alternate between backlog and recent
  visits.</li>
</ul>

Well I am very tired so goodnight.
