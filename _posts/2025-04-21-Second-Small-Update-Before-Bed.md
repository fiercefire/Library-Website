Just wanted to post a small map progress update. I have now added 49-99 the Cooperative Library System & San Joaquin Valley Library System. I plan on filling out the Santiago 
Library System (Orange County) next. I am making sure to fill in missing libraries from the consortiums (as best I can). I am achieveing this with a spreadsheet of data from
the California State Library California Public Library Directories. I am cleaning it up as I go so I'll share that at a later date.
