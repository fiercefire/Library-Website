<p>This is the beginning.</p><br>

<p>I just decided to start this little blog for myself on a whim. My posts will probably be all over the place (whatever comes to mind). I should probably revisit the libraries already visited pre-blog creation to gather some photos and think about some reviews/thoughts on the library. Could be a good segway into photography. I have been thinking about starting with a Minolta x-370 a 35mm film camera.</p><br>

<p>As you can see I have a Google My Maps (what a crap name, doesn’t roll off the tongue at all) embedded into the main part of the blog, I’m too lazy to style the site right now so it’s all basic right now. It’s pretty self-explanatory, green is visited and red is not visited. Going to use the book icon for public libraries, the grad cap for academic libraries, and the question mark for special libraries/archives.</p><br>

<p>Currently, I am finding libraries with a “California Library Systems” map from the California State Library. It shows California divided up into regions governed by library consortiums. I only have the Southern California Library Cooperative inputting at the moment (LA and Ventura County). I should be pretty accurate (if a bit outdated) but when I am feeling less lazy I will need to do ALOT of double-checking. I am of course referring to the library consortium sites for an updated list of member libraries.</p>

<p>I am also thinking about maybe adding in food spots that stand out to me in the future, who knows if that'll be happy lol. Oh, and if anyone is wondering I am typing this on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240201173640/https://deskthority.net/wiki/Northgate_OmniKey/101">OmniKey Ultra 101</a> a Northgate Computer Systems Keyboard (white Alps).</p>

<p>Yes, the photo was very lazily taken with my phone.</p><br>

<p>Anyway, that's all for now. Bye!</p>
