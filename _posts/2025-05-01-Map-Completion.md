All done with the map! I might consider make a different map with EVERY public library location and not only one from each system in the future.

Here is the the Google Sheets of all the public library locations (data originally from California State Library): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tp9KaTl7jPrT6xrRwBrHXrpvuw8d7F3btIlyTQ0Kb2o/edit?usp=sharing

Oh and I finally plan on making a library post at some point this week or next week, idk feeling a little lazy at the moment.
