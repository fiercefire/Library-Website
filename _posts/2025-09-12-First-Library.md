Finally talking about libraries on the site I made to talk about them. WOOO! As a reminder, the images are kinda small in the post. Open the images in a new tab to view them at 
full size.

            <figcaption>My beloved Alhambra Library card. The design is simple and old. The current card design is different now.</figcaption>

</div>

<br>

Pictured above is my library card. This is one of the first designs from the current location. Sadly, I think at some point I lost my original card T_T. Although I think my mom
does have the design from the old location, I will add that in to the post when I ask her about it. The current design is different now, and I do not know what it looks like. 
Both mine and the current design are on the simple side. There is no choice of card design to my knowledge. 

<br>

I am going to start off with the first library I have visited and the one I have spent the most time in, the Alhambra Civic Center Library. Unfortunately, I have no concrete visit date
because that was way too long ago, and I can't remember now :P. I can say that I started being a patron at the Alhambra Library before the current modern building (more on that at the end 
of this post. Which I honestly I'm not a big fan of aesthetically. It is much too plain white and blocky for my tastes. I will admit there is some nice art but not enough to make 
me like the building as a whole.

<br>

</div>

<br>

As you can see from the two images, the library has two floors. It even has a outdoor patio area which sadly is rarely open, if ever. The second floor also includes the non-fiction
books, the friends bookstore (it is so/so imo), a plant swap area, lots of seating, printing area, and study rooms. To be honest, I am not super familiar with it anymore, since I do 
not go to the library as often as I used to, and they did some major reorganizing in recent years. A lot of computers were removed, the reference desk was moved, and various other 
things. I believe there is a conference room upstairs as well.

<br>

Moving to the first floor, which has quite a lot going on. We have the circulation desk across from the adult computer area. The adult area occupies about half of the first floor and, in
addition to the computers, there are fiction books, large print books, newspapers, and foreign language books. I cannot think of the languages off the top of my head, but I will update
this post if I remember to go and look. Near the west entrance there is the passport processing area which moved out of an office by the east entrance for some reason. Oh! and I almost
forgot the self-checkout machines by the circulation desk, which are fairly new. Moving to the next area by the circulation desk is the teen area. I have not been into the teen area in
many years now, but it is not really an enclosed space, so it is pretty easy to observe the space. There is a wall of computers which I now am not quite sure it there anymore. And 
honestly a pretty small collection of YA books. The manga section has quite a nice selection. Overall, I think the library is a nice selection, physcially, at least, I rarely interact with
e-book services. Aside from the seating areas, study rooms, printers, new book area, event bulletin, and conference room (event area). The final area is the children's section. 
It's quite large and very much its own enclosed area. I am not familiar with how it looks anymore, but I spent many, many hours as a kid in the children's section reading and using the 
computers. In fact I used them so much as a kid and a teen that I have my library number memorized. 

<br> 

I didn't structure that very well lol, hopefully you got a good idea of the space. I will yoink the map from Google Maps to better visualize the space. It's very cool
that Google Maps, maps out the inside of the building. 

<br>

Oh, and of course, I cannot forget the little community gardens the library has set up outside the library. It is very new and not something I know very much about. There are also 
benches outside along with book return boxes.

The Alhambra library has only one branch which serves the entire city. The Alhambra Library does participate in universal borrowing, so any California resident can get a library card
for free (GO Us!). However, aside from the central location. We do have a bookmobile and a self-service vending machine with books AND board games.

I honestly cannot remember when the library changed over to the current library building. When I get a chance I will go to the library to check the dates. There are pictures and 
plaques of the three buildings at the east end of the library right by the free plant seeds (which I totally forgot to mention earlier). The Alhambra Library does not have its own
archive sadly, but we do have the Alhambra Historical Society.

            <figcaption>This is the library of my memories. I really like how it looks (my friend said it reminds them of The Bower Museum). As you can see I yoinked this terrible quality image from mapquest because this is the only image I can find. I will change it out for a better photo if I can source one. Maybe I can ask if the Historical Society has one.</figcaption>

I cannot remember when the location changed to the current one, but I do remember that I somehow ended up getting forced into giving a speech at the opening of the new library
location. What a terrible memory. I was so nervous and definitely gave a terrible speech (not that most ppl assume a child will be a fantastic speaker). Probably one of the reasons 
I hate public speaking to this day. 

<br>

Anyway, that's all I can think about writing right now. I will add in new stuff to the post if I feel like it. Hopefully this post is even readable since it's so 
stream of consciousness in writing style. I will no doubt be back to make corrections to post later. Toodles!
