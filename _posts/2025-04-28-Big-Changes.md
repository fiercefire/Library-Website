So I made some big changes to the photos. Moving forward they are going to be kinda low quality .webp images to save on space. All the images have also been relocated to a seperate
repo because the main Github pages repo needs to be kept under 1 Gb. Additionally, when there are a lot of photos on a post they will be reduced to 50% width. If you want to see them 
full sized then right-click them and open the image in a new tab. If you really want to see them in their original quality email me and I will share them if I have them. 

Ok now that's out of the way lets blitz through the rest of the updates.
I added the "Chronological" tag to all posts so in the blog archive page there will be a category that has all the post in date order from beginning to end.
I have updated the blog introduction on the main page to condense it down a bit.
I have gotten my hands on the Olympus om-1n I ordered and will hopefully resume my library visits soon. So look forwards to those.
I plan to finish the rest of my library map by the end of the week.
Oh and there will now be a "Planned Posts" and "Changelog" section at the end of each post.
