Small addendum to my previous post. It's morning now, I am writing this before going to work. I realized last night in bed I forgot to mention I build a small preliminary "About Me" page. I am planning on fleshing it out eventually so who knows if everthing there now will survive so check it out while you can. 

Also, yes I am totally making all this tiny quick posts to test how the posts look on the home page. Trying to figure out if they will show all keep showing up eventually making the 
scroll bar a ridiculous mess. 

Well I gotta run, toodeloo.
