All done with Region 8 which is the Inland Library System. The region covers Inyo, San Bernardino, and Riverside County. All that is left is to fill out Region 1 & 2 which cover 
Northern California and The Bay. Almost done. I also fixed the font so it will show up for everyone now and not just me. WOOHOO!

That's it, signing off.
